# Pinwheel

Two utility tools built as a part of Pinwheel's coding challenge. The first utility tool takes in input from the command line on the specified tax form name e.g. Form W-2, Form 1095-C and returns json data on the form number, form title, minimum year, and maximum year. The second utility tool takes in a tax form name and a range of years and downloads all of the PDF files in a subdirectory.
